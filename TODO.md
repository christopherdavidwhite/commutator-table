# To-do list. #

## Formatting ##

- [x] Separate single particle and two particle operators (done).
- [ ] Add spin-1/2 system separately?

## Operators to add. ##

Should dot products of vector operators be distinct?

- [ ] Hamiltonian of purely kinetic energy.
- [ ] Hamiltonian of purely potential energy.
- [ ] Hamiltonian of both kinetic and potential energy.
- [ ] Lagrangian operator.
- [ ] Rotation operator (e.g., generator of J_x)
- [ ] Angular momentum raising operator
- [ ] Angular momentum raising/lowering operators.
